# What's new in github-code-search v1.3.0

> Full release notes: <https://github.com/fulll/github-code-search/releases/tag/v1.3.0>

## Highlights

### Richer `upgrade` output

The `upgrade` subcommand now prints a detailed post-upgrade summary so you immediately know
what landed in the new version:

```
Welcome to github-code-search v1.3.0!

What's new in v1.3.0:
  https://fulll.github.io/github-code-search/blog/release-v1-3-0

Release notes:
  https://github.com/fulll/github-code-search/releases/tag/v1.3.0

Commit log:
  https://github.com/fulll/github-code-search/compare/v1.2.4...v1.3.0

Report a bug:
  https://github.com/fulll/github-code-search/issues/new

Run `github-code-search --help` to explore all options.
```

It mirrors the experience you get with `bun upgrade` — you always know where to look for details.

### Update-available notice after searches

When a newer release exists, a notice is printed on `stderr` after non-interactive (`--no-interactive` / CI) searches, so it never pollutes piped output:

```
╭─ Update available ──────────────────────────────────────╮
│ github-code-search v1.2.4 → v1.3.0                      │
│ Run: github-code-search upgrade                         │
╰─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

The check races against a 2-second timeout so slow networks never delay your pipeline.

### Colorized `--help` output

When the terminal supports color, the `--help` output is now styled for readability:

- Section titles are **bold yellow**
- Flags and options are **green**
- Subcommands are **cyan**
- Arguments are **yellow**
- Documentation links are _italic_ and **cyan underlined**

Color is automatically disabled when output is piped or the terminal doesn't support it.

### Deep doc links in `--help`

Every subcommand's help text now includes direct links to the relevant documentation page,
so you can jump straight from the CLI to the full guide:

```
$ github-code-search query --help
...
Docs: https://fulll.github.io/github-code-search/usage/interactive-mode
      https://fulll.github.io/github-code-search/reference/cli-options
```

### What's New blog section in the docs

The documentation now has a [What's New](/blog/) section where each release gets a dedicated
page with feature highlights, usage examples, and links to release notes.

For major releases, a blog stub is auto-generated by the CI pipeline when the tag is pushed.
